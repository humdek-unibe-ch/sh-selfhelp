# SelfHelp WebApp

The SelfHelp WebApp is a tool that allows to create a web application that serves as a platform for research experiments.
The basic concept is as follows:

Pages are organized as a collection of sections that are rendered on the page, one below the other.
Sections have different `styles` which define the appearance of the sections.
Depending on the style of a section, the section has different `fields` which define the content of the section.
The value of a field can be a simple plaintext or a collection of child sections which have their own styles and children.

Currently available styles include, but are not limited to, alert boxes, buttons, card containers, forms, media elements, tabs, lists, and support for markdown texts.

 ```
 Define PROJECT_NAME __project_name__
 Define PROJECT_PATH __project_path__
 Define PROJECT_PATH_SERVER ${PROJECT_PATH}/server

```
 - Enable the site with: `sudo a2ensite selfhelp`
 - Enable URL rewriting with: `sudo a2enmod rewrite`
 - Finally, reload apache2 to apply all these changes: `sudo service apache2 reload`

## Update
 - run the `sql` files in the correct order from folder `server/db/update_scripts`.
 - after update clear the `cache`. Now as a workaround it could be done from page `cms->preferences`,  on save of this page the cache is cleared

## Admin Accounts
After all SQL scripts are installed, you should add an administrator account with the following SQL commands (replace the values with your information):

```sql
-- Add your email as admin
INSERT IGNORE INTO users (email, `name`, id_status) 
VALUES ('your.email@example.com', 'Your Name', (SELECT id from userStatus WHERE `name` = 'invited' LIMIT 0,1));

-- Create validation code for password reset
INSERT IGNORE INTO validation_codes (`code`, id_users) 
VALUES ('admin_setup', (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'your.email@example.com'));

-- Add user to admin group
INSERT IGNORE INTO users_groups (id_users, id_groups) 
VALUES ((SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'your.email@example.com'), 
        (SELECT id FROM `groups` WHERE `name` = 'admin' LIMIT 0,1));
```

After running these commands, you can use the password reset functionality with your email to set up your admin account.

Note: If you are affiliated with the University of Bern, specific admin accounts may already be configured.
