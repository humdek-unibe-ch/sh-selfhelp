Mapping the ManyToOne Relationship
In this example, each category can be associated with many products. But, each product can be associated with only one category. This relationship can be summarized as: many products to one category (or equivalently, one category to many products).

From the perspective of the Product entity, this is a many-to-one relationship. From the perspective of the Category entity, this is a one-to-many relationship.

When you define entities you can check the DB structure in this file: @db\structure_db.sql
Define the enitites with orm attribute. Generate the required getter and setters
Print in chat: "ENTITY RULE" when you desing an entity

NEVER run doctrine migration in terminal. This command will be allwasy run manually
