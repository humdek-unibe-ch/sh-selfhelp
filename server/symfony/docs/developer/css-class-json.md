# Generating Tailwind CSS Classes JSON for the Backend

This project uses a dynamic list of Tailwind CSS classes for the `select-css` field type in the CMS. The backend loads this list from a JSON file generated by a script. To keep the backend and frontend in sync, follow these steps to regenerate the JSON file whenever the CSS class patterns or safelist change.

## How to Generate the JSON File

1. **Navigate to the Symfony backend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd server/symfony
   ```

2. **Run the generator script:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/generate-css-classes.js
   ```

   - This will generate two files in `server/symfony/public/assets/`:
     - `tailwind-classes.json` (the full class list for the backend)
     - `tailwind-classes-summary.txt` (a summary for debugging)

3. **Verify the output:**
   - Check that `public/assets/tailwind-classes.json` exists and contains the expected classes.
   - The summary file shows a sample and the total number of classes exported.

## When to Regenerate
- When you update the patterns/variants in `scripts/generate-css-classes.js`.
- When Tailwind config or your frontend safelist changes.
- After upgrading Tailwind or adding new utility classes.

## Notes
- The backend will automatically use the latest JSON file for select-css options.
- If the JSON is missing or invalid, a fallback set of classes is used (see `SectionFieldService.php`).
- You can add or adjust patterns in `scripts/generate-css-classes.js` as needed.
