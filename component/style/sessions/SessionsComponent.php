/**
 * A component to provide an overview of the available sessions.
 *
 * This component uses the navSection component as a content element which is
 * not a simple style but has its own model. Therefore it is necessary to create
 * a custom sessions component that can propagate the necessary information.
 *
 * Note that it would also be possible to not instantiate the nav component in
 * this class here but instantiate the nav model in the SessionsModel class and
 * the NavView in the SessionsView class.
 *
 * The component requires the following fields:
 *  'title':
 *      The title rendered into a jumbotron.
 *  'text_markdown':
 *      A description of sessions page that is rendered below the title.
 *  'continue_label':
 *      The button label that leads to the session the user is currently working
 *      on.
 *  'progress_label':
 *      The label that is rendered next to the progress bar.
