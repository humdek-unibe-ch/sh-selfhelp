# Steps to Create a new Experiment

In the following the expression `__experiment_name__` will be used as a placeholder for the experiment name.

**Do not use underline in this name as it causes issues with the database name!**


# After version v1.1.8

### 1. Clone the latest release from GitLab 

```
cd
git clone gh@tpf.fluido.as:SLP/SLP-sleep_coach.git __experiment_name__
cd __experiment_name__
```

Checkout the latest relaese.
The expression `__latest_release__` is used as a placeholder for the latest version number.
To list all releases use the command `git tag`.

```
git checkout v__latest_release__
```

### 2. Install SelfHelp 

```

sudo ./install.sh -n __experiment_name__ -p __db_password__ -u __os_user__

```

# Before version v1.1.8

### 1. Clone the latest release from GitLab 

```
sudo su www
cd
git clone gh@tpf.fluido.as:SLP/SLP-sleep_coach.git __experiment_name__
cd __experiment_name__
```

Checkout the latest relaese.
The expression `__latest_release__` is used as a placeholder for the latest version number.
To list all releases use the command `git tag`.

```
git checkout v__latest_release__
```

### 2. Prepare the asset and css folder

```
chmod 777 assets
chmod 777 css
```

### 3. Set the global variables of the experiment

```
cp server/service/globals_untracked.default.php server/service/globals_untracked.php
```

Edit the file as follows:

- set `PROJECT_NAME` to `/__experiment_name__`
- set `DBNAME` to `__experiment_name__`
- set `DBUSER` to `__experiment_name__`
- set `DBPW` to `__db_password__`

where `__db_password__` is a secure password with

- length >= 8
- at least one upper case and one lower case letter
- at least one number
- at least one special character

### 4. Prepare the database script

```
cp server/db/privileges.default.sql server/db/privileges.sql
```

Edit the file as follows:

- set the variable `@db_name` to `__experiment_name__`
- set the variable `@user_name` to `__experiment_name__`

### 5. Set up the db

Log out as `www` user with `ctrl-d` and login to mysql with

```
sudo mysql
```

Once the mysql console is open run the commands

```
CREATE USER '__experiment_name__'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '__db_password__';
CREATE DATABASE __experiment_name__ CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
USE __experiment_name__;
source /home/www/__experiment_name__/server/db/selfhelp_initial.sql;
source /home/www/__experiment_name__/server/db/privileges.sql;
```

Quit mysql with `ctrl-d`.

### 6. Set up apache configuration

Login as `www` user and cd to the project

```
sudo su www
cd /home/www/__experiment_name__
```

Prepare the apache configuration file

```
cp server/apache.default.conf server/apache.conf
```

Modify the configuration such that it suits your needs.
What is required is to set the correct project path:

```
Define PROJECT_PATH /home/www/__experiment_name__
```

and an alias which defines how the page will be accessed by url

```
Alias /__experiment_name__ ${PROJECT_PATH}
```

Log out as `www` user with `ctrl-d` and enable the experiment with

``` 
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
sudo ln -s /home/www/__experiment_name__/server/apache.conf __experiment_name__.conf
cd ../sites-enabled
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/__experiment_name__.conf .
```

Restart the apache server and the page should be accessible at `https://selfhelp.psy.unibe.ch/__experiment_name__`

```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

### 7. Enable User Reminder

The server periodically checks whether a user was inactive for more than a specified amount of time and can be configured to send a reminder email if this is the case.
This feature can be enabled and disabled individually for each experiment.
To do this, the correct permissions have to be granted and the new project has to be added to the table `projects` of the DB `selfhelpReminder`.

As user `www` do

```
cd
cd __experiment_name__
cp /home/www/selfhelp_reminder/db/reminder_db_script.default.sql server/db/reminder_db_script.sql
```

and edit the file as follows:

- set the variable `@db_name` to `__experiment_name__`

Log out as `www` user with `ctrl-d` and login to mysql with

```
sudo mysql
```

Once the mysql console is open run the commands

```
USE __experiment_name__;
source /home/www/__experiment_name__/server/db/reminder_db_script.sql;
```

The following list provides a short description of the columns in the table `projects` of the DB `selfhelpReminder`:
 - `id`: An automatically incremented unique id for each project. Do not touch this.
 - `db_name`: The exact name of the database belonging to the project (this will most likely be set to `__experiment_name__`).
 - `url`: The part of the url that is appended to the host address which allows a user to reach the project (this will most likely be set to `__experiment_name__` which results in a full url `https:\\selfhelp.psy.unibe.ch/__experiment_name__`).
 - `has_reminder`: If set to '1' the reminder is activated for this project. If set to '0' the reminder is deactivated for this project.
 - `days`: Specifies the number of days a user must be inactive to receive a reminder email.
