### Database Configuration

A MySQL database server is used and phpmyadmin is installed to manage the databse.
Access of the `root` user is only possible from `localhost` and is disabled from outside the server.
For development purposes a user `tpf` was created which grants external root access.

Each experiment requires a new database and a new user.
