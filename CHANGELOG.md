For 'Every week,' users have the flexibility to choose specific weekdays on which the job should occur. For instance, they can select Monday, Wednesday, and Friday as the days for the job to repeat. Similarly, for 'Every month,' users can specify particular days of the month for the job to recur. For example, they might choose to repeat the job on the 1st, 15th, and 30th days of each month. This functionality allows users to customize their scheduling preferences according to their specific needs and requirements. Additionally, users must set a deadline date, which is mandatory and always used, to indicate the date after which no more jobs will be scheduled.

### New features
 - #461 - add field `url_param` to style `entryRecord` - The `url_param` field specifies the name of the URL parameter that will be extracted from the URL. This parameter is utilized to filter the form based on the `record_id` and return a single entry. When the specified URL parameter is present in the URL, its value is used as the `record_id` to fetch the corresponding entry from the database. This allows for dynamic filtering of the form entries based on the value provided in the URL.
 - #461 - add field `scope` to styles `entryRecord`, `entryList` and `loop`. The 'scope' field serves as a prefix for variable naming within the context of the style. If set, it is appended to the beginning of variable names, allowing for better organization and distinction of variables within the style. For example, if the 'scope' is set to "item", variables within the style will be prefixed with "item_", such as "item_title", "item_description", etc. Using a scope helps to avoid naming conflicts and provides clarity in variable usage within the style.
 - #461 - add as global variables all parameters that comes form the URL. The parameters variable name is with prefix and suffix `__`. Example for URL: `/nested/[i:main_id]/[i:sub_id]` will generate global parameters: `__main_id__` and `__sub_id__`
