A demonstration of available styles can be found [here](https://www.tpf.philhum.unibe.ch/selfhelp_demo/styles).

The app is designed in such a way that it can be extended with new styles or custom components without having to modify existing code.
Some instructions on how to extend the code can be found [here](https://www.tpf.philhum.unibe.ch/selfhelp_demo/extend).

A tutorial for first steps in creating a new SelfHelp WebApp can be found [here](https://www.tpf.philhum.unibe.ch/selfhelp_demo/assets/tutorial.pdf).

The documentation of the source code can be found [here](https://www.tpf.philhum.unibe.ch/selfhelp_demo/doc/doxygen/html/index.html).
